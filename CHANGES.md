Changelog for the Windows Installer
===================================

0.4 (unreleased)
----------------

* Added single-user installation mode as the default installation mode--now
  Sage can be installed without Administrator privileges on the system.
  Installing Sage with this mode means users can modify files in their Sage
  installation without Administrator privileges (ideal for tinkering and
  installing additional packages!)


0.3 (2017-12-15)
----------------

* Added a license agreement page to the install wizard.


0.2 (2017-08-07)
----------------

* Initial version tagged for the SageMath 8.0 release.
